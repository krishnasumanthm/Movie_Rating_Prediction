Movie_Rating_Prediction
=======================
The task here is movie ratings are predicted from the recent twitter feed. A model is trained using the training dataset from the Stanford AI lab’s “Large Movie Review Dataset”. This model is used to do sentiment analysis of each tweet thereby classifying it as positive or negative and accordingly a rating is assigned for the tweet.
